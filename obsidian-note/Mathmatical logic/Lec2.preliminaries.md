# Set

Set cardinality: the number of elements in a set, denoted as |A|.

  

Aset can be defined by:  
• Extension (外延): define by listing all elements  
• Intension (内涵): define by commoncharacteristics  

  

If φ(x) represents a property (common characteristics), then {x | φ(x)} denotes the set of  
all elements that have this property  

  

Axiom of Extension  
The two sets A and Bare equal (A = B)if and only if A and B have the same members  

  

If A is a set, then {X | X ⊆ A} is the power set of A (the set of all subsets of A), i.e., P(A).

# Relation

元组（可重，有序，有限）

Atuple has properties that distinguish it from a set:  
• Atuple maycontain multiple instances of the same element, e.g.,  
⟨1, 2,2,3⟩ ̸ = ⟨1,2,3⟩  
• Tuple elements are ordered, e.g., ⟨1,2,3⟩ ̸ = ⟨3,2,1⟩  
• Atuple has afinite number of elements while a set may not.

pairs where x is in A and y is in B.)  
A×B={⟨x,y⟩ | x ∈ Aandy ∈ B}  
Abinary relation R over sets X and Y is a subset of Cartesian product A × B, denoted as  
R ⊆A×B.  
Intuitively, a binary relation from a set X to a set Y is a set of ordered pairs ⟨x,y⟩ where x is  
an element of X and y is an element of Y.  

二元关系

The statement ⟨x,y⟩ ∈ R reads “x is R-related to y”, and is denoted by R(x,y) or xRy.  
WhenX =Y,wecallarelation R from X to Y a(binary) relation over X.  
(R 是X中的一个二元关系)  

n元关系

Cartesian product of sets A1,A2,...,An(n ≥ 1):  
A1 ×A2 ×...×An = {⟨x1,x2,...,xn⟩ | x1 ∈ A1,x2 ∈ A2,...,xn ∈ An}  
Denoted as An if A1 = A2 = ... = An = A.  
If R ⊆ An,Ris denoted as an n-ary relation over A  

等价关系

Let R be a binary relation on a set A.  
• R is reflexive(自反) if for all x ∈ A, xRx.  
• R is symmetric(对称)if for all x,y ∈ A, if xRy, then yRx.  
• R is transitive(传递) if for all x,y,z ∈ A, if xRy and yRz, then xRz.  
Ris an equivalence relation (等价关系) on A if A is nonempty and R is reflexive,  
symmetric and transitive  

等价类

Given an equivalence relation R over a set A, for any x ∈ A, the equivalence class(等价类)  
of x is the set  
[x]R = {y ∈ A | xRy}  
[x]R is the set of all elements of A that are equivalent to x.  

Key properties:  
• Every element belongs to exactly one equivalence class.  
• Different equivalence classes are disjoint.  
• Thesetof all equivalence classes forms a partition of A (集合的划分).  

偏序关系

- Abinary relation R on a set A is antisymmetric (反对称的)if for all x,y ∈ A，if xRy  
    and yRx, then x = y.  
    • Abinary relation R on a set A is a partial order (偏序关系)if R is reflexive,  
    antisymmetric, and transitive.  
    

eg.xRyRz, x is minimal element, z is maximal element

全序关系

Formally, a partial order relation R on a set A is a total order (linear order), if for any  
x, y ∈ A,either xRy or yRx.

# Function

函数

Afunction from a set X to a set Y is a binary relation R between X and Y that satisfies the  
two following conditions:  
• Foranyx ∈ X,thereexists y ∈ Y such that xRy.一定有映射  
• If y,z ∈ Ysuchthat xRy and xRz, then y = z.且只有一个  
Afunction from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y.  

f : A →B  
expresses that f is a function from set A to a subset of set B.  
• The domain(定义域)off: thesetofinput values  
• The codomain（陪域、上域）of f: the set of possible output values  
• The range(值域)of f: the set of actual output values, i.e., a subset of the B  
• We typically use f(x) = y to denote ⟨x,y⟩ ∈ f.、  

n元函数

If the domain of f is the Cartesian product A1 × A2 × ... × An(n ≥ 1), then f is called  
an n-ary function.  
• Ann-ary function maps ordered n-tuples from its domain to elements in its  
codomain.、  

Given a function f : X → Y:  
• Injective (one-to-one, 单射): if each element of the codomain is mapped to by at  
most one element of the domain, i.e., for all x1,x2 ∈ X, if f(x1) = f(x2) then x1 = x2.  
• Surjective (onto, 满射): if each element of the codomain is mapped to by at least  
one element of the domain, i.e., for any y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y.  
• Bijective (one-to-one correspondence, 双射): if each element of the codomain is  
mapped to by exactly one element of the domain. That is, the function is both  
injective and surjective

# Mathmatical definition

归纳定义

The set N of natural numbers is inductively defined (归纳定义) by the following rules:  
(i) 0 ∈ N  
(ii) For any n, if n ∈ N, then n + 1 ∈ N  
(iii) Only n generated by (finite iterations of) (i) and (ii), n ∈ N  

The above definition can be equivalently stated as follows:  
Nis the smallest inductive subset of S that satisfies conditions (i) and (ii):  
(i) 0 ∈ S  
(ii) For any n, if n ∈ S, then n + 1 ∈ S  
An inductive definition always implies that we are looking for the smallest set such that  
the given rules hold.  

归纳证明

- Basecase: Weneedtoshowthat P(n) is true for the smallest possible value of n,  
    e.g., P(n0) is true.  
    • Induction Hypothesis: Assume that the statement P(k) is true for any positive  
    integer k ≥ n0.  
    • Inductive Step: Show that the statement P(k + 1) is true  
    

递归定义

For any n ∈ N,thevalue of f(n) can be computed from the above definition using  
f(0), f(1), ..., f(n − 1), and this type of definition is referred to as recursive definition.
