A → B (A entails B, B follows from A)\

Truth for statements, Validity for arguments/reasoning. They are not the same.

Mathematization/Formalization of the intuition is Mathematical Logic  
• Using Mathematical logic, we could formally prove that a reasoning is valid, like we  
did with Math.  
• Using Mathematical logic, even machines could perform reasoning, and validating  
reasoning  

## history

Moderntreatment descends from the Greek tradition, particularly Aristotelian Logic,  
core of which includes Reductio ad absurdum (归谬法，Reduction to absurdity) and  
syllogism (三段论)  

The origins of modern mathematical logic are often attributed to  
Leibniz.  
• Constructing a “universal language” (通用语言，a universally applicable, precise  
scientific language).  
• Constructing “calculus of reasoning” (推理演算，similar to a computational calculus,  
capable of proving correctness or incorrectness)  

- George Boole and A. De Morgan presented systematic mathematical treatments of  
    propositional logic  
    • GottlobFrege and Charles Sanders Peirce independently developed the foundation  
    of first-order logic  
    • Great Logicians: Bertrand Russell (罗素), David Hilbert(希尔伯特), Gerhard  
    Gentzen(甘岑), Kurt Gödel(哥德尔), and Alfred Tarski(塔斯基)  
    
- How do we express ambiguous natural language reasoning formally?  
    — Formal languages (形式语言): a precisely defined set of symbols and syntax rules.  
    Using symbols and apply syntax rules to form formulas, where formulas represent  
    propositions  
    • How do we prove that a reasoning is valid?  
    — Formal Deduction System(形式推演系统): logical truth or falsity of propositions is  
    expressed through deductive calculations based on the formulas and rules.
